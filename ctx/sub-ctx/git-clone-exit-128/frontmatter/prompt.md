After observing jumpstart/init.py, please propose why init logged it as failed even though when I look at the remaining directory, it looks like it cloned properly - I was able to run the command below and get a response:

```bash
git -C ~/chromium_src log --oneline -n 3
```

It seems like a false positive error to me.
