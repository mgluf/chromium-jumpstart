This file was generated using [Repomix](https://repomix.com) to flatten selected source files into a format that is easy for language models to consume. The generation process was augmented using `usr-ctx`, a file-based CLI tool that injects structured frontmatter, context-specific notes, and custom metadata into the final output. Unlike a full-repository rollup, this context may represent a targeted subset of files—called a "sub-context"—to focus the model’s attention on a specific area of the codebase or problem domain.
