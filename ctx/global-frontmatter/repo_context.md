This repo represents `chromium-jumpstart`. A custom open-source chromium toolkit intended to “jump-start” the notoriously bloated and potentially confusing dev stack that is chromium source. 

- Streamline installing dependencies and cloning chromium src (macOs only for now)
- Spin up a new chromium fork with a single command via a prompt based experience.
- Create multiple projects that share a single chromium source to conserve drive space.
- Define feature exclusion, build settings and more via a config.json
- Out-of-the box Browser ↔ front-end API pipeline (generic built for extension)
