# Chromium Jumpstart

> ⚠️ **Status**: Paused / Incomplete
> This project was an experimental attempt to streamline the process of forking and customizing Chromium. It didn’t fully materialize but might still be a useful reference for others.

## Overview

**Chromium Jumpstart** was envisioned as a quickstart scaffold to automate the repetitive and complex steps involved in:

* Cloning the Chromium codebase
* Setting up a basic custom brand / build identity
* Making trivial modifications (e.g., UI strings, branding)
* Building a minimal fork for local development or experimentation

The goal was to make it easier for devs to create their own Chromium-based browser fork without manually navigating the deep, often undocumented Chromium build ecosystem.

## Why It Was Paused

After exploring the Chromium toolchain, it became clear that:

* The Chromium project is **massive and complex** (e.g., GN/Ninja build system, depot\_tools, custom dependency management).
* Many steps are **non-trivial to automate** and frequently break due to upstream changes.
* The value of a "quickstart" is limited without deep customization or ongoing maintenance.
* Other tools like `ungoogled-chromium`, `electron`, and `chromium-based starter templates` often offer more reliable entry points depending on the goal.

Ultimately, this project was paused after some early scripting and experimentation. It serves now more as a **learning artifact** and jumping-off point than a finished solution.

## What’s Inside

The repo contains:

* **Scripts** attempting to automate checkout, build config, and minor patches
* Some **stub configuration files**
* A rough scaffold for future tooling or documentation

You’ll likely need to manually update or fix many parts if you try to run them today.

## Who Might Still Find This Useful

* Devs curious about Chromium’s build/setup flow
* Hobbyists exploring browser forking
* Hackers interested in scripting large open-source build environments

## Next Steps (If Revived)

To continue or revive this project, here’s what would help:

* Better abstraction over Chromium’s constantly-evolving build system
* Smarter error handling for `depot_tools` and GN/Ninja config
* Modularizing custom branding and patching steps
* Documenting successful use-cases (even tiny ones)
